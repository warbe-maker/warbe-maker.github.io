#### Blog
This blog is dedicated to posts regarding 
- Information and aspects of my _Common Components Management_ approach e.g.
  - VB-Projects dedicated to the development, 
testing, and continuous improvement of _Common Components_ 
  - Usage i.e. uodate/synchronization of _Common Components_ used in VB-Projects
- Modules which do offer some extra value for example my mErrHndl module or a _VBA MsgBox Alternative_
- Procedures often used and regarded mature enough worth being published
- Experience made with VB-Projects and GitHub
- and others
