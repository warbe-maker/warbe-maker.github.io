#### About this blog's content
This blog is dedicated to 
1. Information and aspects of what I call _Common Components_ such as
 - their hosting, development, and test in dedicated VB projects/Workbooks
 - their update/synchronization in VP projects using them by means of a _Common Component Management Addin Workbook_
2. Modules which do offer some extra value such as
 - [Common VBA Error Services][1]
 - [Common VBA Message Services][2]
1. Procedures often used and regarded mature enough worth being published
1. Experience made with VB-Projects and GitHub

and others
