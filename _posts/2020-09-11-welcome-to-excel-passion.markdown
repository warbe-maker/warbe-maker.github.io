Finally I've found a home - at the age of 70 - for some of my _Common Excel Components_ (VBA modules) which had grown over decades - and hopefully had become mature enough worth being published. For example:
- A [VBA MsgBox Alternative](<https://github.com/warbe-maker/MsgBox-Alternative>) for appealing messages with minimum effort
- A [Common Error-Handler]() providing
  - the "path to the error"
  - means to "trace the execution time"
  - display of the error message either by means of the VBA MsgBox or the  [VBA MsgBox Alternative](<https://github.com/warbe-maker/MsgBox-Alternative>)
- An Excel-Workbook serving as plug-in for the "automated update of common modules" used in VBA projects

Others still to become worth being published though I am never completely satisfied with results.
