Finally I've found a home - at the age of 72 - for some of the "common Excel VBA modules" which had grown over decades of using Excel - and hopefully had become mature enough worth being published.
- A MsgBox alternative (already gone [public on github](<https://github.com/warbe-maker/MsgBox-Alternative>))
- A common Error-Handler which includes
  - the provision of the "path to the error"
  - means to "trace the execution time"
  - making use of the MsgBox alternative
- An Excel-Workbook serving as plug-in for the "automated update of common modules" in VBA projects making use of them. In other words an automated synchronization for dedicated modules
- Some code-snippets, etc.
