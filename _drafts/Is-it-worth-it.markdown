The question whether it is worth it or not rises whenever a post, a module, or a procedure is looking for the public.
Though the code I'd like to publish has been used for years and matured over time demands escalate immediately when the decision has been made. Is the quality sufficient? Is everything really completely tested? Does the code add any value to the thousands of published solutions? Will anybody else value what has a definite value for me?
All these open questions are likely to end up in a "let it be".

What has worked well for so long often requires a general rework and a lot of additional testing. When a solution is about to become public all of a sudden it appears incomplete and of poor quality.
