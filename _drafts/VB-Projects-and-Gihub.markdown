This post documents the initial enthusiasm for the matter also expressed by the fact that I've turned all my dedicated _Common Component Workbook Folders_ into GitHub repositories now waiting for the state making it worth going public.

### Advantages
1. It's free of any charge no matter whether the VB-Project remains private or is made public
2. It versions any changes
3. It provides the means to make a code change in a branch first and once successfully tested merge the branch into the master.
4. When turned public other GitHub users may make use of the project or even contribute to it
5. An optional but rather obligatory  README document provides the place for the description, installation and usage of the project
6. All documents for the project use Markdown which is easy to use and sufficiently capable for user friendly appearance. A good example for this is Microsoft's VB Documentation.

### Preconditions
1. Dedicated VB-Project folders<br>
I myself keep VB-Projects in a dedicated Workbook folder already for a long time. Whenever such a Workbook is saved or closed all modules the code has changed are exported to this dedicated folder as a backup in case the Workbook/VB-Project gets corrupted which happened every now and and made all the code unreadable. Now, in connection with GitHub this turned out a perfect means for the versioning if each module offering a way back to a previous version and making the changes 
2. A GitHub user account
